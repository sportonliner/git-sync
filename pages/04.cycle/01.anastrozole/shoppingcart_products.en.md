### Anastrozole: King of Aromatase Inhibitors

Arriving from the family of Aromatase Inhibitors (AI), Anastrozole is
one of the most effective anti-estrogens. Zenaca Pharmaceuticals developed Anastrozole in the early 1990s and it was launched in the market in the
year 1995 under the name Arimidex. It is one of the most commonly used and available anti-estrogen available in the market today. It is highly
effective, much more than the traditionally used Nolvadex. It is also very famous
and top-choice among professional bodybuilders.

If you are using aromatizing steroids, Anastrozole will surely provide
you with impressive benefits. For instance, you might suffer from
estrogen-related side-effects, like gyno and water bloating if you are using aromatizing steroids. Adding Anastrozole while on cycle, you will completely reduce
the possibility of these side-effects. Moreover, you will also get a more
solid and ripped body.

Anastrozole is a highly effective aromatase inhibitor. Innumerable AAS
users rely on Anastrozole to protect themselves from estrogen-related side
effects. This is because AAS can result in aromatization and an excess production
of estrogen that will affect your gains and health. As a result,
Anastrozole is one of the most commonly recommended drugs for both amateur and
professional bodybuilders who are on AAS cycle.

### Benefits of Anastrozole for men

While there are many other drugs that can tackle the side effects of
estrogen in men as well as in women, Anastrozole is the best among them. There
are multiple ways to reduce the amount of estrogen – destroy it, block it,
occupy the existing receptors of estrogen, reduce SBHG or prevent increased
amount of testosterone from aromatizing to estrogen in the first place. Last one
is how Arimidex work.

The way Anastrozole acts is very simple and it is highly effective at
the same time. It is able to inhibit the aromatization process to reduce the
amount of estrogen in the body. In studies, it has been found that it suppresses
as much as 80% of estrogen. While it surely is very effective, the results can
vary. The only thing that is sure is that you will get impressive results.

Using Arimidex for men will prevent the development of side effects
caused due to estrogen while on AAS cycle. A large number of anabolic steroids
result in severe side- effects related to estrogen because testosterone interacts
with the aromatase enzyme. When aromatization takes place, the amount of
estrogen starts rising that can lead to water retention and gyno. Moreover, this
can also affect your gains during the cycle and accelerate the rate at which
you lose the gains after the AAS cycle.

Not all the AAS result in aromatization and also the ones that do lead
to aromatization will not compulsorily lead to estrogenic side effects.
Dianabol is prone to aromatization to an extent, whereas Sustanon carries a
major possibility of aromatization.

If you are on steroids that can lead to it, you will be protected from
water retention and gyno by using Arimidex. You will also be able to gain
better results from the cycle. Moreover, it will protect you from hypertension.
As Arimidex helps in preventing aromatization, which is the process of testosterone converting into estrogen, it can be used in PCT (Post
Cycle Therapy) and treatment plans that are recommended for low testosterone
levels.

### Anastrozole Dosage

How much Arimidex to take? As far as the dosage of Anastrozole for men
is concerned, you are required to consume very small amounts of it. The
Arimidex dosage ranges between 0.25 to 0.50mg per day. If you are only beginning
with an Anastrozole cycle, you can consume half of this dosage. If it is
being used for treatment of low testosterone levels, then even lesser amount should
be used.

As testosterone is a common drug in any AAS cycle, it is important to
find a way to manage estrogen. Anastrozole for men can be a perfect choice for
this job as it does the job of keeping the estrogen levels in control easily.
While the results may vary among users, generally 1/4th of an Anastrozole
tablet is sufficient in most of the cases when the testosterone amount is lesser
than 750mg in a week. Remember that more amount of Anastrozole will be
required if you are using Dianabol or other aromatizing compounds; and lesser if you
are using Primobolan, Anavar or other non-aromatizing compounds.

### Anastrozole in PCT (Post Cycle Therapy)

While Anastrozole is already popular as an Aromatase Inhibitor, another feather has adjoined its crown in the recent years – a PCT drug. While
SERMS, like Clomid, were generally used in the past, Anastrozole is gaining
huge popularity as a PCT drug which helps in the recovery by inhibiting the
excess amounts of estrogen that can take place after a cycle in suppressed
stages. HCG is generally recommended in these stages, however, it can also
increase estrogen. As a result, a lot of people now prefer using Anastrozole
along with HCG for added safety.

### Possible Arimidex Side Effects

Anastrozole comes with its own share of possible side effects. Most of
the Arimidex side effects will be related to how you respond to the drug.
The type of sides that are very common with not only AAS but also with other
common medications, like Aspirin. Some of us can use Aspirin while others
cannot. Similarly, the side effects of Anastrozole will also depend on your
response to its usage. People who use Anastrozole without using an anabolic
steroid generally complain of fatigue and weakness. As a matter of fact, these
are the most commonly observed Arimidex sides.

If you are on an AAS cycle, the low dosage of Anastrozole for men should
not result in any weakness or fatigue. But they can be observed if you are
on a competition or hard cutting cycle where training is very intense and
calorie consumption is very low.

Anastrozole side effects are not related to cholesterol levels but when
used alone, there have been certain cases where it does. Nonetheless, you are
still required to follow a healthy lifestyle. Your diet should not contain
heavy amounts of simple sugars and saturated fats, and high amounts of omega
fatty acids are recommended.

### Anastrozole Reviews

AI all over the world. If you use anabolic steroid, Anastrozole is what you

### How Much Arimidex Costs?

One of the most common reasons for people to not buy Anastrozole is its
high cost. Especially the beginners, who dont know that it’s extremely
effective, do not usually buy it as it is very expensive. Many people believe that
buying an AI, which is even more expensive than anabolic steroids, doesn’make a
lot of sense. This group of people generally look for other alternatives
that are easily affordable or generic Anastrozole.

Experienced users understand that the effectiveness and benefits of
Arimidex are the key to better gains and safety. And they prefer investing in
it, irrespective of the cost. If you are using an anabolic steroid, what is
the value of using it when you are not able to gain the desired results? Experienced users have this approach towards bodybuilding and as a
result, they do not mind investing in Anastrozole.

prone to developing tissues around the chest area. This condition is known as Gynecomastia or ‘’itch- Tits’’ While this is already annoying enough,

this. Anastrozole is an excellent remedy for preventing the growth of
maleboobs. Arimidex is one of the most commonly used drug that is used by most of
the beginners and even pro bodybuilders using steroids throughout the world.

### Where to Buy Anastrozole?
