> In healthcare, steroids offer a variety of benefits; pain relief, decreased inflammation, and gain weight. They also suppress the immune system, which helps people with autoimmune disorders – very important uses that are widely accepted by medical professionals worldwide.

Anabolic steroids also suppress your body’s ability to naturally produce testosterone by filling your testosterone receptors and tricking your body into thinking there is enough free hormone circulating around your body. By doing this, Anabolic steroids also stimulate the growth of tissue and increase muscle mass due to their endrogenic properties that retain nitrogen – cruicial when building muscle proteins.

When steroids are used for performance enhancement, anabolic steroids build muscle, burn fat, and improve appearance.

In order to do that, you need to start by understanding the most popular steroids out there.

* **Stacking**: Mixing injectable steroids and oral steroids to enhance the affects.
* **Pyramiding**: Increasing doses gradually for 6-12 weeks of cycle, this allows the body acclimatized to high doses of steroids.

### **Before Anabolic Steroids Use. Steroid Pills and Injects Dosage**

### **Muscle Gain on Gear. Get the Best Results from Steroid Use**

Thinking of starting your first cycle of steroids? For a first timer this can seem very daunting and the internet is full of complicated information, mostly written by novices themselves. Steroid usage is safe as long as you have done your research and made sure that you know what you’re doing. Make sure you are fully aware of any problems that may occur – it’s not enough to just read the label, although this is a good place to start. There are more things that should be considered and you should make sure you have a clear idea in your head before you start.

Sometimes the information you come across is unreliable. But here are some handy tips for use to help you start off on the right foot:
* Be aware that what worked for your gym buddy might not work for you – your body is completely different. Start with beginner steroid cycles and progress from there – don’t jump straight in with a more complex cycle until you know what does and doesn’t work for you.
* Have a clear goal in mind and make sure it is achievable – prioritise between gaining strength, adding bulk, reducing body fat and adding definition. Plan your cycle in advance and keep it short (between 6 – 8 weeks) – if your cycle goes beyond 10 weeks you may find that your body has trouble recovering and producing natural testosterone.
* Stacking steroids can be an effective way to maximise muscle building – stacking an androgenic steroid with a mild, anabolic steroid can be a good idea as they complement each other.
* Don’t take two oral steroids at a time as this can harm your liver – try and stack an injectable steroid with an oral one.
* Make sure you give your body enough high-quality protein in order for the steroid to work – protein is the raw material your body needs and is found in eggs, meat, cheese, milk and yoghurt.
* Your diet will matter more than ever and you can’t relax and expect steroids to work if you aren’t eating well – consumer 60% of your calorific intake from carbohydrates and 30% from protein.
* Eat regularly and aim for about six meals ever day even when you aren’t feeling particularly hungry – and try to keep these meals at the same time of day.
* Use supplements and multi-vitamins to help keep your body in top shape – liver support, kidney support and fibre supplements will help keep you healthy.
* Get enough sleep (at least eight hours a night) – when taking steroid pills your body needs to recharge at night in order to properly function.
* Work twice as hard on steroids as you did off them – heavier weights, longer workouts or greater numbers of sets and repetitions. Accept that steroid pills are not magic – if you don’t put in the time and effort, concentrating on your diet and gym efforts, then you’re wasting your money.
